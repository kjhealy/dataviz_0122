Maybe you're familiar with R already, but I don't assume it. So please bear with me. I do find that, often, it's good to revisit some of the basic features of R and RStudio, as very often people learn them on an as-needed basis, which leads to some gaps. So hopefully even if you are a bit familiar with these tools you'll learn some new things.

Michael Zoorob, 2020, Do Police Brutality Stories Reduce 911 Calls? Reassessing an Important Criminological Finding 

This comment reassesses the prominent claim from Desmond, Papachristos, and Kirk (2016) (DPK) that 911 calls plummeted—and homicides surged—because of a police brutality story in Milwaukee (the Jude story). The results in DPK depend on a substantial outlier 47 weeks after the Jude story, the final week of data. Identical analyses without the outlier final week show that the Jude story had no statistically significant effect on either total 911 calls or violent crime 911 calls. Modeling choices that do not extrapolate from data many weeks after the Jude story—including an event study and “regression discontinuity in time”—also find no evidence that calls declined, a consistent result across predominantly black neighborhoods, predominantly white neighborhoods, and citywide. Finally, plotting the raw data demonstrates stable 911 calls in the weeks around the Jude story. Overall, the existing empirical evidence does not support the theory that publishing brutality stories decreases crime reporting and increases murders.


This visual inspection of the data yields several important insights. First, none of these plots suggest calls declined dramatically—or at all—in the weeks following the Jude story. Call patterns after the story are notably unre- markable. Second, contrary to claims of a disproportionate reduction in calls in black neighborhoods (DPK, p. 870), call patterns in black neighborhoods do not trend differently from all Milwaukee neighborhoods after the Jude story (although black neighborhoods exhibit higher average call rates). Third, a statistical outlier appears in the final week of data, corresponding to December 25, 2005, to December 31, 2005. This outlier proves highly influential.
